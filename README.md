This sql exercise shows my approach to find what percent of people in a web product selected 'other' in a residence type field in the funnel and then changed their answer from 'other' within 30 minutes of the first time they completed a funnel experience. This is a typical kind of question asked which standard BI tools cannot answer easily but is quite simple with conditional statements in SQL and its datediff fuction.
